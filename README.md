Minestuck is a mod for Minecraft that adds game elements from the webcomic Homestuck into Minecraft.

Side B is a fork of Minestuck for 1.12 continuing to add unique content to that of the original.

As of right now, it's strongly recommended to have read at least the first four acts of Homestuck, and preferably also the fifth act before delving into this mod.

We hope to implement:
* Places like Skaia, Prospit and Derse
* Title powers
* Sprites and Prototyping
* More stuff in land
* Tons of Homestuck themed items
* And more!
