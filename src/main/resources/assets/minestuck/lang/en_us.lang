The Energy Modus can be charged by captchaloguing an Energy Cell, each one corresponding to one point.

#Rainbow
consort.genericGreen=Have you ever noticed rainbow wood looks green from a distance? I wonder if green is somehow more generic than other colors.

consort.typesOfColors.4=In the subtractive system, mixing magenta and yellow makes red, mixing yellow and cyan makes green, and mixing cyan and magenta makes blue!
consort.typesOfColors.5=These six colors make up the color wheel: red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta, and then back to red.
consort.typesOfColors.6=When you look at a rainbow, you don't see magenta, because the blue on one end doesn't mix with the red on the other end.

consort.typesOfColors.16=When mixing red and blue to get magenta, the blue overpowers the red and you get purple. You have to mix the purple with not just red, but pink to get magenta.
